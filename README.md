# Fetal ECG Approximation
This branch is dedicated to the development of a fetal ECG approximation algorithm, using complex neural networks.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `models/`: Contains the trained models.
- `results/`: Contains various results obtained during testing.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Acquire the required dependencies, including packages and datasets. (TODO: Add requirements.txt)
3. Run the `train.py` script to train the model.

Disclaimer: Average time for an epoch on GTX 3060 is 2 minutes.
